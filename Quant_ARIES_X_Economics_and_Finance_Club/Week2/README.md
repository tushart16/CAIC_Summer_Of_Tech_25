# WEEK-2

## Stock Market Prediction: Model Implementation and Evaluation

### Objective

Build, evaluate, and backtest predictive models for stock price forecasting using Linear Regression, ARIMA, and Random Forest. This week focuses on applying machine learning and time-series techniques to financial data, evaluating model performance, and simulating a trading strategy.

### Assignment Details

1. _Choose a Stock_  
   Select the AMZN stock.

2. _Data Splitting_  
   Split the data into training (first 80%) and testing (last 20%) sets, ensuring the split respects the time order.

3. _Model Implementation_  
   Implement the following models:

   - _Linear Regression_: Predict the next day's closing price using the past 5 days' closing prices as features.
   - _ARIMA_: Forecast the closing price using an ARIMA model.
   - _Random Forest_: Predict the closing price using technical indicators (e.g., 7-day and 30-day moving averages, RSI) as features.

4. _Model Evaluation_  
   Evaluate each model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or accuracy for direction prediction (whether the price goes up or down).

5. _Model Comparison_  
   Compare the models based on MAE and identify the best-performing one.

6. _Backtesting the Best Model_
   - Generate buy/sell signals: Buy if the predicted price > current price, sell otherwise.
   - Calculate the hypothetical profit/loss over the test period.

This assignment emphasizes applying machine learning concepts, evaluating model performance, and connecting to practical finance through a simple trading strategy.

### Getting Started

- Use the dataset prepared in Week 1 (price-volume data for US stocks/ETFs).
- Ensure your Jupyter Notebook environment is set up with necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and statsmodels for ARIMA.
- Refer to Week 1 resources for data preprocessing steps if needed.

---

### Next Steps

- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest and ARIMA to improve performance.
- Explore additional features (e.g., volume, other technical indicators) to enhance model accuracy.
- Document your findings and trading strategy results in your notebook for submission.
