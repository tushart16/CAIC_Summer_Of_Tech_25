# ðŸ§® Wolfram, Who? â€” by MathSoc

**One topic. One PDF. A few great problems. Every week.**

Welcome to *Wolfram, Who?* â€” a weekly problem-solving series by **MathSoc**.

Each week, we explore a new area of maths â€” from the elegance of **number theory** to the logic of **algebra** and the structure of **graphs** â€” through a short reading PDF and a set of hand-picked problems.

This isnâ€™t about speed or competition â€” itâ€™s about patterns, ideas, and the joy of figuring things out.
