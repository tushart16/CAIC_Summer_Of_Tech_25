# 🧮 Wolfram, Who? — by MathSoc

**One topic. One PDF. A few great problems. Every week.**

Welcome to *Wolfram, Who?* — a weekly problem-solving series by **MathSoc**.

Each week, we explore a new area of maths — from the elegance of **number theory** to the logic of **algebra** and the structure of **graphs** — through a short reading PDF and a set of hand-picked problems.

This isn’t about speed or competition — it’s about patterns, ideas, and the joy of figuring things out.
