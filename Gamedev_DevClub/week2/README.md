# Week 2: Core Game Mechanics Implementation

Welcome to Week 2 of the Game Development Track for DevClub Summer of Code 2025! With your Unity environment set up and a game concept in mind, it's time to breathe life into your ideas.

This week, you’ll begin actual development by building the foundation of your game’s interactive world. From designing your player character and implementing unique game mechanics to shaping immersive environments and constructing a working game loop, you’ll start turning your vision into a playable prototype.

By the end of Week 2, you’ll have a character you can control, core gameplay features that align with your narrative themes, a basic but functional environment, and a simple UI-supported game loop. This marks a major milestone in your journey—your project begins to take shape as a real game.

### Step 1: Player Character Development

- Create a player character with basic movement controls
- Implement character controller (2D or 3D depending on your choice)
- Add player animations and state management

### Step 2: Core Mechanic Prototyping

- Implement 1-2 unique mechanics related to your chosen themes
- For “Echoes of a Forgotten Past”: Memory collection, flashback mechanics
- For “Truth is a Glitch”: Reality-altering mechanics, visual distortions
- For “No One’s in Control”: Random events, procedural generation
- For “Looping Consequences”: Time rewinding, cause-effect chains
- For “This Isn’t Real”: Reality switching, perception mechanics

### Step 3: Environment Creation

- Design and build a basic game level/environment
- Implement environmental interactions
- Add basic lighting and visual effects
- Create atmosphere that supports your themes

### Step 4: Core Game Loop Implementation

- Create a basic game loop (start, play, end/restart)
- Implement simple UI elements (menus, HUD)
- Add win/lose conditions
- Create basic scoring or progression system

### Week 2 Checkpoint: By the end of Week 2, you should have:

- A playable character with basic movement and animations
- Core game mechanics implemented that reflect your chosen themes
- A basic environment/level to play in
- A functional game loop with simple UI
