# CAIC Summer of Tech 2025: Full-Stack Development Track

## Introduction to Full-Stack Chat App Development

Welcome to the Full-Stack track of the CAIC Summer of Tech 2025! This track focuses on building a comprehensive real-time messaging application similar to WhatsApp and Telegram. Over the next five weeks, you'll dive deep into modern web development technologies and learn to build scalable, secure, and feature-rich messaging platforms from scratch.

## Why Learn Full-Stack Development with Messaging Apps?

Messaging applications are among the most complex and challenging projects in software development, requiring expertise in real-time communication, media handling, security, and user experience design. Building a messaging app teaches you:

- Real-time communication using WebSockets and modern frameworks, essential for live applications
- Media processing and storage for handling photos, videos, audio, and documents efficiently
- Authentication and security fundamentals to protect user data and communications
- Database design and optimization for handling millions of messages and user interactions
- API integration with third-party services for enhanced functionality
- Responsive design principles for seamless cross-platform user experiences
- Scalable architecture patterns used by major tech companies
- Modern deployment strategies for production-ready applications

By building a complete messaging platform, you'll gain valuable full-stack development skills that are highly sought after in the modern tech industry!

## What We'll Be Building

Throughout this track, we'll develop a Complete Full-Stack Chat Application with the following components:

- **Core Messaging System**: Real-time text messaging with delivery status, typing indicators, and emoji support.
- **Media Sharing Platform**: Photo/video capture, editing, compression, and sharing with thumbnail previews and download capabilities.
- **Video Calling Integration**: Seamless video and audio calling using Jitsi Meet integration with call management features.
- **Language Translation Service**: Real-time message translation using Google Cloud Translation API for global communication.
- **Authentication & Security**: Token-based authentication system with secure session management, basic encryption, and secure Login/Register.
- **File Management System**: Document sharing, audio recording, and comprehensive file handling.
