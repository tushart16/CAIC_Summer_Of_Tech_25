# DevClub Cybersecurity Course – 5 Week Plan

Welcome to the cybersecurity vertical of the CSoT part by DevClub, IIT Delhi. This short course is designed to provide a hands-on, engaging introduction to practical cybersecurity through the lens of offensive security techniques. Over the next five weeks, you’ll explore key areas such as Linux fundamentals, cryptography, web and network security, and exploitation techniques—culminating in weekly CTF challenges to apply what you've learned.

While the course emphasizes offensive techniques (red teaming) to make learning fun and interactive, understanding these methods is essential for anyone looking to defend systems effectively. Whether you're interested in ethical hacking or system security and auditing (blue teaming), this foundation will help you recognize, exploit, and ultimately mitigate real-world vulnerabilities.

**Start Date:** To be decided  
**Format:** Weekly resource bundles + self-paced study + weekend CTF challenges  
**Audience:** IIT Delhi students

## Conclusion

By the end of this 5-week journey, you’ll have built a strong foundation in key cybersecurity concepts with a practical, hands-on understanding of how real-world attacks are carried out and mitigated. This course aims to equip you not just with technical skills but with the mindset to approach problems like a security professional — whether as an ethical hacker, red teamer, or systems auditor.

Understanding offensive security is a critical step toward building secure systems. Through this course, you’ll gain insight into how vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited, which is essential for anyone aiming to build, defend, or audit secure infrastructure. Whether you continue toward bug bounty hunting, competitive CTFs, or defensive security roles, you now have the core tools and thinking patterns to go deeper.

The challenges won’t stop here — but neither will your ability to solve them.
