# 🚗🏙️🌱 Sustainable Mobility Case 2025

Design a tech-driven, low-emission urban mobility plan for a major Indian city by 2030/2040.

---

## Background  
Urban transport contributes ~12% of India’s CO₂ emissions and faces growing congestion and pollution. India’s climate commitments (45% emissions-intensity reduction by 2030, net-zero by 2070) demand bold, equitable mobility solutions. This challenge asks teams to develop a data-driven, tech-enabled strategy that shifts travel toward clean modes, electrifies vehicles, and fosters behavioral change.

---

## Objectives & Themes  
1. **Modal Shift**  
   - Boost public (bus, metro) and active (walk, cycle) mode share  
   - Transit-oriented development, dedicated lanes, first/last-mile solutions  
2. **Electrification**  
   - Integrate EVs (2W, 3W, cars, buses) with renewable-powered charging  
   - Plan network of chargers, grid upgrades, and incentives  
3. **Smart Mobility & Data**  
   - Use simulation (SUMO, MATSim) and GIS to model traffic flows  
   - Apply AI/ML for demand forecasting and infrastructure siting  
4. **Policy & Finance**  
   - Propose congestion pricing, parking reform, TOD policies, and mobility bonds  
   - Outline financing: public budgets, PPP, carbon credits  
5. **Behavioral Change**  
   - Design nudges, gamified apps, awareness campaigns targeting all demographics  
6. **Impact Assessment**  
   - Quantify CO₂ & PM₂.₅ reduction, ridership growth, equity gains  
   - Provide cost–benefit analysis, NPV or marginal abatement cost curve
