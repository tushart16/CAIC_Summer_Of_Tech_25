# 🚗🏙️🌱 Sustainable Mobility Case 2025  
### Design a Low-Emission, Equitable Urban Mobility Plan for an Indian Urban/Metro City

---

## 🧠 Background  
Urban transport contributes approximately 12% of India’s CO₂ emissions. As Indian cities grow, traffic congestion, air pollution, and unequal access to mobility services are worsening. In light of India’s climate commitments (net-zero by 2070, 45% emissions intensity reduction by 2030), there is a need for bold, inclusive, and locally grounded solutions.

This case challenges student teams to develop a city-specific sustainable mobility strategy for 2030/2040. The goal is to rethink how people move—shifting away from car-centric planning and toward clean, accessible, and affordable modes of transport. Teams will explore the intersection of policy, behavior, infrastructure, and urban design.

## 🎯 Challenge Objective

Choose any Indian metropolitan or large urban city (e.g., Bengaluru, Pune, Surat, Kolkata) and propose a Low-Emission Mobility Strategy by 2030 or 2040 that:

- Reduces CO₂ emissions from transport  
- Enhances access and equity across social and income groups  
- Promotes public and active transport (walking, cycling)  
- Supports electric mobility and clean vehicle adoption  
- Introduces policies that are financially and politically feasible  

No advanced technical simulation or coding is required. However, students are encouraged to use maps, visuals, and secondary data to support their proposals.

## 🧩 Case Themes & Components

1. 🌍 **Modal Shift & Accessibility**  
   - Shift from private vehicle usage to public and active transport  
   - Improve first–last-mile connectivity  
   - Focus on transit-oriented development and equitable access

2. ⚡ **Electrification & Cleaner Vehicles**  
   - Promote EV adoption (2W, 3W, buses)  
   - Suggest EV infrastructure rollout (charging stations)  
   - Consider local air quality and grid readiness

3. 📊 **Policy & Governance**  
   - Design supportive policies (e.g., congestion pricing, parking reforms)  
   - Recommend urban planning or zoning changes  
   - Align with city/state climate action plans

4. 💸 **Finance & Implementation**  
   - Estimate capital and operating costs for key interventions  
   - Propose funding options (municipal budgets, state schemes, PPPs)  
   - Explore climate finance, green bonds, or mobility subsidies

5. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Behavior & Awareness**  
   - Identify groups resistant to clean mobility adoption  
   - Design outreach, incentives, or education campaigns  
   - Propose inclusive strategies for women, seniors, low-income groups

6. 📈 **Impact Estimation**  
   - Estimate reduction in CO₂ or PM₂.₅  
   - Predict increase in public/active transport use  
   - Highlight improvements in affordability or accessibility

## 📦 Final Deliverable (Week 5)

- **Comprehensive Report (PDF, 6–8 pages)**  
  - **Executive Summary (½ page)**: Overview of problem, vision, and top recommendations.  
  - **City Baseline & Vision (1–2 pages)**: Summarize Week 1 and Week 2 findings (mode share, emissions, vision, scenarios).  
  - **Stakeholder & Infrastructure Plan (1–2 pages)**: Capture Week 3 outcomes (stakeholder roles, infrastructure concepts).  
  - **Policy & Finance Strategy (1–2 pages)**: Consolidate Week 4 recommendations (policy measures, pricing, funding sources).  
  - **Impact Assessment & Roadmap (1–2 pages)**: Estimate CO₂/PM₂.₅ reduction, mode-shift gains, equity improvements, and present a phased implementation timeline.

No separate slide deck is required—teams should focus on a clear, concise narrative within the 6–8 page limit.

## 💡 Guidelines for Teams

- Form interdisciplinary teams.  
- Use real data where available; clearly state any assumptions.  
- Balance ambition with practicality—proposals should be innovative yet implementable.  
- Design with the end user in mind—consider women, elderly, low-income workers, and persons with disabilities.  
- Emphasize equity, sustainability, and clarity.

Good luck and enjoy reimagining how Indian cities can move cleanly, fairly, and efficiently into the future!
