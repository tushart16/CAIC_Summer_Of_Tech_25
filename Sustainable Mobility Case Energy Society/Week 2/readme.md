# Week 2: Vision & Scenario Development

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Define a clear, long-term vision for 2030 or 2040 that makes your chosen city’s transport system low-emission and equitable  
- Create two alternative future scenarios—one “Moderate Change” and one “Ambitious Change”—that illustrate different pathways to reach that vision  
- Prepare a concise summary of high-level inputs (e.g., policy ideas, infrastructure concepts, rough cost ranges) needed for Week 3

## 📌 Key Tasks

1. **Vision Statement & Goals**  
   - Write a short (½ page) statement describing where your city’s mobility should be by 2030/2040.  
     - Example: “By 2030, 50% of all trips in City X will use public transit, walking, or cycling; CO₂ emissions from transport will be reduced by 40%; and underserved neighborhoods will see daily commute times cut in half.”  
   - Tie these goals to national climate commitments (e.g., India’s 45% emissions-intensity reduction by 2030) and any available local targets.

2. **Scenario A: Moderate Change**  
   - List 3–4 realistic interventions that build on existing efforts (e.g., adding a few dedicated bus lanes, modest EV bus subsidies, improving sidewalk connectivity).  
   - For each intervention, note:  
     - A brief description  
     - Expected outcome (Quantitaive where possible; e.g., “Bus lanes on Main Street could shift 10% of private-car commuters to buses”)  
     - Rough cost indication (low/medium/high, based on similar projects or online estimates)  

3. **Scenario B: Ambitious Change**  
   - Outline 4–5 more transformative measures (e.g., full BRT corridor, citywide protected bike network, congestion pricing in downtown, large-scale EV charging rollout).  
   - For each measure, include:  
     - A brief description  
     - Expected outcome (e.g., “Protected bike lanes could raise cycling share from 5% to 20% of short trips”)  
     - Rough cost indication (low/medium/high)

4. **High-Level Inputs Summary**  
   - **Infrastructure Concepts:** List the major capital items you will need in Week 3 (e.g., kilometers of new bus lane, number of bike-share stations, EV chargers).  
   - **Policy Ideas:** Note key policies or regulations needed (e.g., increased parking fees, EV purchase incentives, transit fare integration).  
   - **Stakeholder Roles (Preliminary):** Identify who must be involved—e.g., city transport authority, bus operator, power utility, local NGOs.
