# CAIC Summer of Tech 2025: Full-Stack Chat App Development
## Week 2: Authentication System and Core Messaging Logic

Welcome to Week 2 of the Full-Stack Development Track! This week builds upon the foundation you established in Week 1. Now that you have your development environment set up and understand the basics of HTTP, APIs, and JavaScript, we're ready to start building the core functionality of our messaging application.

This week focuses on creating a secure authentication system using Express + MongoDB for user management, some UI/UX setup- giving you hands-on experience with development concepts.

## What You'll Build This Week

By the end of Week 2, you'll have:
- Backend setup: Node.js and Express server
- Database setup: MongoDB for user data storage
- User models & CRUD routes: Complete user management system
- Basic messaging UI/UX: Clean React interface

## Quick Review: What We Learned in Week 1

- Backend vs Frontend: Backend = server magic, Frontend = user interface
- HTTP Status Codes: 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Server Error)
- Development Tools: Node.js, React, Postman, Chrome DevTools
- Basic JavaScript: Functions, promises, API calls
- Project Structure: Organized folder structure for both frontend and backend

## Learning Tasks

Before diving into implementation, you need to understand these core concepts that will be essential for building our chat application.

## Week 2 Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Backend Setup (Node.js + Express)

Set up your Express server foundation that will handle all user management and authentication.

**What You Need to Do:**
- Create Node.js project with Express
- Install essential packages (express, cors, dotenv)
- Set up basic server with middleware
- Create basic route structure

**Minimal Starter:**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
// Add your middleware and routes here
app.listen(5000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 5000');
});
```

**Follow These Resources:**
- [Express Hello World](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)
- [Node.js Project Structure Best Practices](https://blog.logrocket.com/organizing-express-js-project-structure-better-productivity/)

**Essential Packages to Install:**
```bash
npm install express cors dotenv mongoose jsonwebtoken bcryptjs
```

### Task 2: Database Setup (MongoDB)

**Goal:** Connect your Express app to a local MongoDB database

**What You Need to Do:**
- Install MongoDB locally on your computer
- Install mongoose package
- Create database connection
- Test the connection

**Installation Guides:**
- [Install MongoDB on Windows](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)

### Task 3: Implementing User Authentication CRUD Operations

**Goal:** Create a complete user management system with RESTful API endpoints

**What You Need to Research:**
- RESTful API design principles and HTTP methods
- Mongoose schema creation and validation
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Express route handling and error management
- MongoDB query operations

**API Endpoints Design:**
Design and implement RESTful API endpoints for user authentication (/api/auth):
- Define endpoints for Create (Register), Read (Login/Profile), Update, and Delete operations

**Your Tasks:**

**User Model Creation:**
- Create User schema with username, email, password fields
- Add validation rules and constraints
- Include timestamps for tracking

**Authentication Endpoints:**
- POST /api/auth/register - Create new user
- POST /api/auth/login - Authenticate existing user
- GET /api/auth/profile - Get user profile
- PUT /api/auth/profile - Update user profile
- DELETE /api/auth/profile - Delete user account

**Security Implementation:**
- Hash passwords using bcrypt
- Validate input data
- Handle duplicate users
- Secure password comparison

**Key Resources:**
- [RESTful API Design](https://restfulapi.net/)
- [Mongoose Models & Validation](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html)
- [bcrypt Password Hashing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)
- [Express Router](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)
- [HTTP Status Codes](https://httpstatuses.com/)

**Minimal Route Structure:**
```javascript
// routes/auth.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// POST /api/auth/register
router.post('/register', (req, res) => {
    // Your implementation here
});
// Add other CRUD routes...

module.exports = router;
```

**Success Criteria:**
- User schema created with proper validation
- All CRUD endpoints implemented and working
- Login verifies credentials correctly
- Passwords are hashed before saving
- Proper HTTP status codes returned
- Error handling for invalid requests
